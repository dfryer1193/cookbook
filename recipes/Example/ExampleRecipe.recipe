#
# Recipes are written in .recipe files, which are a varient of YAML (a markup language). The syntax is pretty simple -
# there are tags, with colon-seperated values. Lines starting with a '#' are comments.
#
# Optional fields have comments starting with <OPTIONAL>. All other fields are required.
#
# In general, white space is ignored. But for consistency: two spaces before hyphens, and single lined values on one line.
# Also try to keep max columns under 120 characters for legibility.
#

# The name of the recipe (at the top of the generated page, and in the table of contents)
name: Recipe

# <OPTIONAL> The source of the recipe to link to
source: www.google.com

# How long does it take to prepare? A number, followed by a time (e.g. 20 minutes or 2 days)
prepTime: 20 minutes

# How long does it take to cook? A number, followed by a time (e.g. 8 hours, or 5 minutes)
cookTime: 20 minutes

# How many portions does it make?
portions: 4

# <OPTIONAL> How many calories per portion?
calories: 200

# <OPTIONAL> This will be placed somewhere at the edge of the recipe.
hint: It's amazing! But you could try replacing the foo with some bar for extra zing.

# What ingredients are required? Each ingredient goes on its own line, like this:
# - (UNIT <QUANTITY>) DESCRIPTION
# The unit (a number) is mandatory, the quantity (a string) is optional, and the description is mandatory.
ingredients:
  - (1 lb) things

# How do we actually make the recipe? One step per line (after the tag), starting with a hyphen.
# Newlines are ok (you can break up your text), we'll only move on to the next step on hyphens.
steps:
  - make the things!
